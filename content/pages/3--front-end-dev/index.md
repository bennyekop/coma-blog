[Fun Coding with Benny Ekop](https://github.com/bennyekop) is a blog I have just launched.

It will be a home for all instruction and tutorial articles relating to my GatsbyJS starters. The dominant subject areas will be of course GatsbyJS but also ReactJS, EcmaScript 2015+ and CSS in JS.

If you want to be informed about new content on the blog follow me on Twitter - [@bennyekop](https://twitter.com/bennyekop).

Are you thinking about a particular subject, relating to the starters, I could write about? Tweet me.
